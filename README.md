# YoutubeDownloader
This is a simple electron app for downloading YouTube videos.
# How to use
To start do 
```
git clone https://github.com/Chickaboo/YoutubeDownloader/
```
If you do not have git I recommend installing it or you can donwload the zip file on the github repo and extract it. Once you have done this cd into the directory of the repo and run
```
npm start
```
From here on you put in the url of the video and click donwload.
